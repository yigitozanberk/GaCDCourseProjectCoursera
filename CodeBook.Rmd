run_analysis.R firstly gathers the data sets from the folders "./test" and "./train" as the data is 
separated into two subsets for testing and training. Then, data is binded into one data frame.

The necessary measurements from the data is the mean and standart deviation for each measurement. The
required 73 columns are selected from the data set and binded with corresponding subject IDs and 
activity labels.

Lastly, data is cast into an aggregation reflecting average values for each measurement for activities
and subjects.
